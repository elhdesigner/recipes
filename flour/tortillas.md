### Tools

- KitchenAid stand mixer
- Dough hook
- Cast iron pan
- Rolling pin

### Ingredients

- 3 cups flour
- 1/4 cup bacon fat/lard/duck fat
- 2 tsp salt
- 1 cup water

## Instructions

1.  Add flour, salt, and fat to mixer. Stir it all up real good.
1.  While the mixer is on, pour in water. Set mixer to 2 (or 3 if you're feeling spicy) and let it work the dough into a nice ball.
1.  On a floured surface, break the dough into ~5cm balls. Squish them down a bit and let them rest for 15-45 minutes.
1.  Heat up a pan. The heat level can be tricky to get right, you want a medium-medium-high. Colder than a nice fried egg but not by much.
1.  Roll out the balls with the rolling pin. Add a bit more flour if its sticking. Keep rotating about somewhere between 45 and 90 degrees with each roll to get a round tortilla, or do whatever if you don't care about aesthetics.
1.  Drop the tortilla in the pan. If the heat is right it should take ~45 seconds before bubbles form and the bottom gets some brown spots. Flip it and do the same time on the other side. If the tortillas get golden all over the pan is probably too cold, and if they get blackened quickly its probably too hot.
