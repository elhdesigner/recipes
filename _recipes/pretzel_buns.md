tools:
- KitchenAid stand mixer

ingredients:
  Dough:
  - 12 ounces warm water
  - 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, cut into small pieces
  - 1/2 teaspoon salt
  - 3 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
  - 3 tablespoons nonfat dry milk
  - 1.25 teaspoon instant or bread machine yeast
  Boil:
  - 1/4 cup baking soda
  - 1 tablespoon salt
  Toppings:
  - Maldon Sea Salt

steps:
- Add all ingredients up to yeast to mixer in order given. Stir until doughy. Swap the stir thing for the dough hook and knead on speed 2. Slowly add more water or flour if the consistency is no good - it should be a slightly sticky ball.
- When the dough has risen into a smooth, elastic ball (about 5-10 minutes), remove dough to floured board or silicone sheet.
- Preheat oven to 400 degrees F convection bake.
- Divide dough into 8 portions and make into balls. Allow to rest for 15 minutes.
- Meanwhile, prepare water bath. Add baking soda and salt to ~2 quarts water and bring to a boil.
- Gently smash each ball into a flat bun-like shape. Drop each bun into your boiling water bath. Cook 30 seconds, then flip and cook another 30 seconds. They will be wrinkly as a raisin.
- Remove each bun to a well-greased cookie sheet or a tray covered with a silicone mat. These buns are prone to major "stickage."
- Use a serrated knife or new single-edge razor blade to slice an X into each bun about 1/2 inch deep. Sprinkle generously with Maldon's.
- Bake 20-24 minutes.
- Remove buns ASAP to a cooling rack. Otherwise, they will stick. When cool, slice horizontally if using for sandwiches.
